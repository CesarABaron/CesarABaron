Throughout my work experience, I have had the opportunity to venture into various sectors, which has provided me with a broad perspective and versatile skills. My professional background encompasses in-person sales, computer maintenance, mobile device repair, graphic design, and my recent transition into the exciting world of technology.

My most recent leap led me to start a career in the field of full-stack web development, where I have had the opportunity to develop my technical and logical skills. During this time, I have gained experience in creating complete web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Node.js. Additionally, I have strengthened my soft skills, including effective communication, problem-solving, and teamwork.

My diverse experience has allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of business and technology, enabling me to approach challenges in a creative and effective manner. I am excited about the opportunity to bring this valuable combination of skills and perspectives to a new team and contribute to the success of my next employer.
